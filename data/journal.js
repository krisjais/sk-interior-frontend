      'We often prioritize colour when imagining an interior — yet texture is the subtle quality that quietly dictates light, acoustics, and emotional comfort. A room defined by raw limestone and slubbed linen will always outperform flat paint.',
    quote: {
      text: 'A room with a single material expressed in several finishes will always feel more considered than a room with many colours applied to flat surfaces.',

    body: [
      'The obsession with colour palettes in modern interior architecture has, in many ways, obscured what makes rooms genuinely pleasurable to inhabit: the tactile intelligence of their surfaces.',
      'When light strikes a wall finished in hand-troweled Venetian plaster or lime wash, it does not bounce uniform flat light back into the room. It catches micro-shadows, releases soft warm tones, and responds dynamically as the sun moves from east to west throughout the day. The room appears alive.',
      'In our studio practice in Mumbai, every project begins with a material audit before a single colour is selected. We ask essential questions: How does this stone feel under bare feet in humid weather? How does wenge wood absorb evening lighting? What happens as this brass hardware oxidizes over years of touch?',
      'By prioritizing honest timber, natural stone, woven hemp, and lime plasters, the colour of the space emerges naturally from the materials themselves — producing an atmosphere of quiet, enduring sanctuary.',

      'There is no single architectural decision more consequential than how light enters and travels through a home. Mapping morning glow and controlling afternoon glare is central to residential luxury.',

      'In coastal India, natural light is both our most exquisite asset and our most complex challenge. Residences facing west receive magnificent evening sunsets over the horizon, but endure harsh midday thermal gain.',
      'We approach every interior by creating a solar map of the floorplate across seasons. This map determines furniture orientation, deep window sill treatments, woven linen shade densities, and shadow reveals.',
      'Artificial lighting must never compete with natural daylight. Instead, we layer warm 2700K indirect LED coves, low-level brass reading sconces, and focused artwork spot lamps. The result is a space that shifts effortlessly from bright morning energy to evening calm.',

      'The most frequent brief we receive from clients includes the request to make a residence feel warm, welcoming, and lived-in. Yet the most frequent error made in pursuit of warmth is accumulating excessive furniture and wall decor.',
      'True atmospheric warmth springs from material integrity — not item density. A clean limestone wall with a single sculptural brass fitting provides far greater emotional weight than twenty framed prints crowded together.',
      'Negative space gives the mind room to rest. It allows air to circulate, shadows to stretch, and key pieces of furniture to be appreciated as quiet sculptural moments.',

      'When we first visited the site for The Sea Villa in Alibaug, the Arabian Sea was visible across the entire tree canopy. The brief was simple: create an interior that dissolves seamlessly into the surrounding garden and horizon.',
      'Accomplishing this meant avoiding precious synthetic finishes that degrade in salt air. We selected solid marine-grade teak joinery, unpolished Kota stone floors that stay cool underfoot, and heavy unbleached linen drapery.',
      'Instead of rigid solid doors between living zones, we specified floor-to-ceiling pivoting timber screens and linen curtains. The house breathes with the coastal breeze, blurring the boundary between indoor sanctuary and outdoor terrace.',
